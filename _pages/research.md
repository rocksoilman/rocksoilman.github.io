Our goal is to build <i>intelligent water systems</i> that use real-time sensing and control to solve modern water challenges.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2><a href="/research/wireless-sensor-networks">Wireless sensor networks for water infrastructure</a></h2> New technologies are enabling real-time supervision and control of previously static stormwater and flood control infrastructure. We are designing a new generation of cyber-physical systems that incorporate low-power embedded electronics, wireless communications, and web services to transform passive water systems into active ones.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2><a href="/research/estimation-and-control">State estimation and control</a></h2> Like self-driving cars, autonomous water systems will require new algorithms to estimate system dynamics from sensor data and guide system behavior towards desirable states. We are exploring how advances in modern control theory can improve our understanding of water infrastructure and inform better operational resilience.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2><a href="/research/digital-twins">Digital twin models of water infrastructure</a></h2> Water managers are increasingly seeking <i>digital twins</i> of real-world water networks that combine sensor data with online models in order to better understand and control system dynamics. In service of this goal, we are building new real-time models that will allow operators to geolocate flooding, detect maintenance emergencies, and better implement dynamic control.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2><a href="/research/coupled-infrastructure-modeling">Coupled infrastructure system modeling</a></h2> Water, energy, and transportation grids are closely linked; yet their coupled dynamics are still poorly understood. We are exploring how critical infrastructure systems interact in a dynamical context, and how coordinated sensing, modeling and control can achieve better resilience of civil systems as a whole.
