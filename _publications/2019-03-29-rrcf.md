## Abstract

In this paper, we present the first open-source implementation of the robust random cut
forest (RRCF) algorithmâ€”an unsupervised ensemble method for anomaly detection on
streaming data (Guha, Mishra, Roy, & Schrijvers, 2016). RRCF offers a number of
features that many competing anomaly detection algorithms lack. Specifically, RRCF:

- Is designed to handle large volumes of streaming data.
- Is well-suited to data of high dimension.
- Reduces the influence of irrelevant dimensions in the input data.
- Gracefully handles duplicates and near-duplicates that could otherwise mask the
presence of outliers.
- Features an anomaly-scoring metric with a clear underlying statistical meaning.

The RRCF algorithm is currently used for anomaly detection in the <i>Amazon Kinesis</i>
real-time analytics engine. The goal of our repository is to provide an open-source implementation of the RRCF algorithm and its core data structures for the purposes of
facilitating experimentation and enabling future extensions.
